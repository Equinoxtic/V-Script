# V-Script

Idk, not a programming language but just some fun C++ program that I'm making (emoji)

## How to compile

Use an IDE that will allow you to compile this C++ program

Recommended : Dev-C++

Once you have installed Dev-C++ open up, "VScript.dev", and press F9 to compile the program
and done, the program is now compiled.

It's your preference to use an actual compiler
