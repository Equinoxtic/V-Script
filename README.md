# V-Script

Idk, not a programming language but just some fun C++ program that I'm making (emoji)

## Installation

Go to the releases page for the downloads!

https://github.com/Equinoxtic/V-Script/releases

## How to compile

Use an IDE that will allow you to compile this C++ program

Recommended : Dev-C++

Dev-C++ (download): https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

Once you have installed Dev-C++ open up, "VScript.dev", and press F9 to compile the program
and done, the program is now compiled.

It's your preference to use an actual compiler
