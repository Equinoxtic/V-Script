## How to compile

Use an IDE that will allow you to compile this C++ program

Recommended : Dev-C++

Dev-C++ (download): https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

Once you have installed Dev-C++ open up, "VScript.dev", and press F9 to compile the program
and done, the program is now compiled.

It's your preference to use an actual compiler

Read, "InstallForMinGW.md" for an installation process with the MinGW compiler.
